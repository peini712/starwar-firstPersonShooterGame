////*** Welcome to Starwar! ***////

The game contains 4 possible pages (welcome screen, game page, win page, lose page).
Press start to go to the game or pause! (Enter)
In this game, you are the small spaceship at the bottom of the screen. 
The enemies are the bouncing red balls. Their speed are not fixed, some are fast and some are slow, so be careful!
You can move horizontally and shoot bullets (A-left, D-right, W-Fire). 
There will be sound when you fire a bullet or when you kill an enemy. So please turn up the volume when you are playing the game!
By default, you will have 3 lives (The number of lives remain is at the top left corner). You will lose when all lives are used up.
Once you are crashed by an enemy, you will lose one life and your color will change at the same time.
You would earn one point at a time when you kill an enemy. If you have earned 10 points, congrats, you're win!
